# SmartPhone Controlled Robotic Arm with 6 Axis
> 6-Axis Robotic Arm Overview:
This project features a 6-Axis Robotic Arm using MG90 and SG90 servo motors, controlled by an Arduino through an HC- 05 Bluetooth module. 

- Each axis serves a specific purpose:

    - Base Rotation (Axis 1): MG90 servo for stable rotation.
    - Shoulder Movement (Axis 2): SG90 servo for precise lifting/lowering.
    - Elbow Flexion/Extension (Axis 3): MG90 servo for accurate elbow movements.
    - Wrist Rotation (Axis 4): SG90 servo for orientation adjustments.
    - Wrist Tilt (Axis 5): MG90 servo for stable wrist tilt.
    - Gripper Control (Axis 6): SG90 servo for gripper manipulation.

- Control System:
    - Arduino interprets commands for servo motors.
    - HC- 05 Bluetooth module facilitates wireless control via a cellphone app.


 - User Interface:
    - Cellphone app with intuitive controls for each axis.

 - Features:
    - Programmability for predefined movements.
    - Safety measures include emergency stop and collision detection.
    - Educational and versatile for various applications.
    
In summary, this robotic arm combines servo motors, Arduino, and Bluetooth for user- friendly remote control, making it suitable for educational purposes and small- scale automation tasks.
