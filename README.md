# 6-Axis Robotic Arm Overview:
This project features a 6-Axis Robotic Arm using MG90 and SG90 servo motors, controlled by an Arduino through an HC-05 Bluetooth module.

## Each axis serves a specific purpose:

 - Base Rotation (Axis 1): MG90 servo for stable rotation. 🔄
 - Shoulder Movement (Axis 2): SG90 servo for precise lifting/lowering. 🤏
 - Elbow Flexion/Extension (Axis 3): MG90 servo for accurate elbow movements. 🦴
 - Wrist Rotation (Axis 4): SG90 servo for orientation adjustments. 🔄
 - Wrist Tilt (Axis 5): MG90 servo for stable wrist tilt. 🤏
 - Gripper Control (Axis 6): SG90 servo for gripper manipulation. 🤖

## Control System:

- Arduino interprets commands for servo motors. 🤖
- HC-05 Bluetooth module facilitates wireless control via a cellphone app. 📲

## User Interface:

- Cellphone app with intuitive controls for each axis. 🕹️

## Features:

- Programmability for predefined movements. 🔄🤖
- Safety measures include emergency stop and collision detection. ⚠️🛑
- Educational and versatile for various applications. 🎓🤖
In summary, this robotic arm combines servo motors, Arduino, and Bluetooth for user-friendly remote control, making it suitable for educational purposes and small-scale automation tasks. 🚀
